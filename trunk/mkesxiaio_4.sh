#	All you now need is to download this file and the vmware ESXi ISO file
#	sudo chmod +x mkesxiaio_x.x.sh
#	sudo ./mkesxiaio_x.x.sh
#
#	You may need to download a extra file like inetd.conf
#
#	You need 2GB of free space to run the script 
#
#	Then you need a blank USB drive minimum 1GB OBS if this script
#	breaks your USB drive or you loose DATA don't blame me.
#	There will be warnings before anything happens to the USB drive.
